#  before PyInstaller builds the exe, so as to inject date/other infos into it.

#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:

# PyCharm
#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.
